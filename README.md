Ball game with teleporting physics

This geme is still in its infancy and needs a lot more work. Rules of the game are to drag the ball with the mouse^ or use arrow keys to move the ball across the closest wall (the one furthest south). The ball will then teleport down from below the northern wall on top of the game arena. However, it is still not working correctly as the physics of the ball keep it from going down and instead collides with the northern wall as it rotates up. In the future I expect obstacles or targets within the middle of the game arena for the person to aim at or avoid. This should entertain the player as he/she tries to master the angles proposed from using a teleportation device that sends their ball/character flying down at the same velocity as when the ball was dragged up while bouncing off the side walls. 


^In the future the ball will be dragged with a person's finger
